This code deals with solving quadratic equations. It has the ability to resolve the following situations:
- a == 0, b!=0, c!=0 and the subsequent possibilities;
  - b == 0 and c == 0;
  - b == 0;
- discriminant greater than 0 or equal to 0;
- discriminant less than 0.

The equation under consideration is:

$$
  ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

where a, b, and c are constants.
